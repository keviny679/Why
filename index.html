                <h1>Why does Universal Design matter?</h1>
                <p>Universal Design matters because everyone should be included and be able to access and make use of websites. As internet users grow and populations grow there will be more people with the need for accessible websites. </p>

                <h2> Benefits of Universal Design </h2> <br>
                <h3> Inclusivity </h3>
                <p> It creates environments and products that can be accessed, understood, and used by all people regardless of their physical or cognitive limitations. By designing with inclusivity in mind, no one is excluded based on their physical or cognitive capabilities. </p> <br> 
                <h3> Appealing to a wider demographic </h3>
                <p> In 2021, the United States alone had a total of 42.5 million reported disabilities which accounts for around 13% of the general population. This incredibly large number is a big chunk of people who could and should be able to make use of websites. It is mutually beneficial for websites to be designed universally since it can account for so many people. </p> <br>
                <h3> Positive Brand Assosciation </h3>
                <p> Companies showing a commitment to equality would be more likely to be viewed in a positive light, which in turn can increase support from their users.</p> <br> 
                <h3> Better Experience for Everyone </h3>  
                <p> By designing for all users in mind, everyone can gain a better experience. This is because aspects of Universal Design tends to be intuitive and more user-friendly, which creates an easier site to use and helps everyone in the end. A great example of this is color contrast, by using accessible colors the design will be more visually appealing to users.</p>

                    <q>It is important to note that organizations that fail to comply with the ADA risk facing legal recourse. This includes potentially receiving an ADA compliance demand letter and facing ADA website compliance lawsuits.</q>

                <h3> Saving Time </h3>
                <p> As companies move towards being inclusive for all, eventually the time will come for those non-inclusive to make the switch to add a new demopgrahic and doing so for more complicated websites could result in a lot more work being required rather than designing universally early on.</p>
